Summarization, translation, Q&A, text generation and more at blazing speed using a T5 version implemented in ONNX. 

This package is still in alpha stage, therefore some functionalities such as beam searches are still in development.

## Installation
ONNX-T5 is available on PyPi.
```bash
pip install onnxt5
```

For the dev version you can run the following.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abelriboulot/onnxt5
cd onnxt5
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

The simplest way to get started for generation is to use the default pre-trained
version of T5 on ONNX included in the package.

> **_NOTE:_**  Please note that the first time you call get_encoder_decoder_tokenizer, the models are
being downloaded which might take a minute or two.

```python
from onnxt5 import GenerativeT5
from onnxt5.api import get_encoder_decoder_tokenizer
decoder_sess, encoder_sess, tokenizer = get_encoder_decoder_tokenizer()
generative_t5 = GenerativeT5(encoder_sess, decoder_sess, tokenizer, onnx=True)
prompt = 'translate English to French: I was a victim of a series of accidents.'

output_text, output_logits = generative_t5(prompt, max_length=100, temperature=0.)
# output_text: "J'ai été victime d'une série d'accidents."
```

If you want to get the embeddings of text, you can run the following
```python
from onnxt5.api import get_encoder_decoder_tokenizer, run_embeddings_text

decoder_sess, encoder_sess, tokenizer = get_encoder_decoder_tokenizer()
prompt = 'Listen, Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.'
encoder_embeddings, decoder_embeddings = run_embeddings_text(encoder_sess, decoder_sess, tokenizer, prompt)
```

ONNXT5 also lets you export and use your own models. See the `examples\` folder for more detailed examples.

T5 works with tokens such as `summarize:`, `translate English to German:`, or `question: ... context:`. You can see a 
list of the pretrained tasks and token in the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf).

## Functionalities
* Run any of the T5 trained tasks in a line (translation, summarization, sentiment analysis, completion, generation)
* Export your own T5 models to ONNX easily
* Utility functions to generate what you need quickly
* Up to 4X speedup compared to PyTorch execution for smaller contexts

## Benchmarks
The outperformance varies heavily based on the length of the context. For contexts less than ~500 words,
ONNX outperforms greatly, going up to a 4X speedup compared to PyTorch. However, the longer the context, the smaller the 
speedup of ONNX, with Pytorch being faster above 500 words.
